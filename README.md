# Etch-a-Sketch - The Odin Project

This is a project from **The Odin Project** curriculum, where I built a browser-based **Etch-a-Sketch** drawing application. The goal was to practice **JavaScript** fundamentals, including DOM manipulation, event listeners, and user interaction.

## Project Overview

This project allows users to draw on a grid of squares by hovering their mouse over them. Users can also adjust the grid size, clear the board, and experience a progressive darkening effect on each square with repeated hovers.

## Features of the Sketchpad

- **Dynamic Grid Creation**: Generates a customizable grid using JavaScript.
- **Hover-Based Drawing**: Colors squares when the mouse passes over them.
- **Randomized Colors**: Each square gets a new random RGB color when hovered.
- **Progressive Darkening Effect**: Each hover increases the squareâ€™s opacity by 10% until it reaches full opacity.
- **Adjustable Grid Size**: Users can define a new grid size (up to 100x100) via a prompt.
- **Clear Button**: Resets the grid without changing its size.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Handles logic, grid creation, event listeners, and user interaction.
- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure for the page.
- **CSS & Flexbox**: Ensures grid alignment and responsiveness.
